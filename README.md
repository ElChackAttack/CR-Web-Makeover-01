This is the first project in what will be, hopefully, a running series of projects aiming to update and/or enhance web applications/sites that the team considers are outdated or unoptimized. This is equal parts a learning experience and an attempt to pitch a better and more easily maintainable product to the corresponding companies. Ultimately, as passionate developers and users we strive to make and aid towards creating cohesive experiences for users engaging with an online product or service.
